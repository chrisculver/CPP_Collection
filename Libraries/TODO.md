Timing Class
------------

Class that uses chrono to get the time, and output the time spent in a block of code.
Maybe want to add a labelling system for each instance, with default message (like gwu-qcd)


Input Class
-----------
In CorrelationMatrixManager I liked the way I parsed the input, lets make that it's own
functional class that can be used everywhere. 


Logging Class
-------------
Just something to make a file and put output there.


Utilities
---------
For example split for strings, few other utils I use a lot


Vector/Matrix Wrappers
---------
Vector/Matrix classes, that are AT LEAST parallelized over cores, maybe start with 
a wrapper with eigen implementation.
